## Initial Feedback 12-12-2017

- You will need to make sure you call all libraries before they are used. 
- `library(shinythemes)` should be called before the initial work. I added this in. 
- The app has a good start to it. You many want to use some css options on your page to adjust fonts and colors. 
- Could you include some sample csv files that I could upload to explore this more. 


## Group Presendation Feedback

- graphics are nice
- Visualizations were helpful. I also like the comparisons feature and the hovering to view points feature. 
- Really like the visualization. Like that you can hover over data points to see more information
-  Ability to hover above graph to see data point values. Adds lots of information and variables to choose from per graph, and ability to compare graphs
- Lots of cool features on this app & the heat map is really cool
- I think this app is fun to play with and has some interesting topics.
- The graphs are fancy.
- my group
- The app provide many choice for graph. And the graphs looks great, you can use it to compare speed between drivers.
- The graphics were visually appealing and well made I thought
- visualization 
- the detail that is shown within the function of the app such as finding stats within the race and being able to zoom into specific parts of the track
- I like the interface and the way the data was visualized.
- It is our app.
- The app is visually appealing
- I love that it has many interactive features and that we can see aggregate data from one driver or data by lap
- Complementing graphs with summary statistics like average and standard deviation of the speed was helpful
- This is my group
- The graphs are pretty good. I like the comparison part.
- App layout is really nice but I could not see what the app does as there was no example CSV file
Good plots.
- The name is creative and so is the idea, the visuals were impressive and the comparison graphs. Just all the information incorporated into the app was so much
- The graph of the track is very cool, and the comparison tool is super useful
- Very good graphs, especially the comparison graphs
- Interesting idea, probably a good tool for racecar drivers
- interesting app
- I like the layout and choice of colour
- cool graphs"
- It was creative
- The design of this app impresses me.

### Suggested Improvements

-  unclear what the usefulness of the app is, also I don´t know what standard deviation of speed is, and - they should be careful about how they are calculating average speed (not just mean of instantaneous speeds recorded)
- "Title could be larger and maybe static would be nice
"
- Allowing people to read in their own data files makes it pretty likely for data problems.  Maybe just work with your own data files. It’d be nice to have some more descriptions abut the graphs and especially the axes
-  Add a more meaningful title to graphs instead of “1”
- Differentiate what's on the main panel vs. side would be easier for users to understand where to put things, changing the width of the graphs to make it stay in the center would be helpful, and labels on - graphs can be made to be more intuitive
- If it is possible, the group members could add a list of records played by the player and computer. So it would be nice for players to know how to improve.
- Add more tabs.
- my group
- Maybe they can set different colors for different graph. So it can look clearer when users choose different graphs and do analysis.
- The graphs need to be labeled and I believe certain concepts need to be explained.
guide on how it work. Also it is too specialized unless there explanation for every term 
- An information tab of some sort to help the user understand the basics of racing and perhaps identify any racing-specific terms used in the app
- Some of the summary variable labels could be renamed instead of taking straight out from R Output.
- Making the installation of packages easier.
- I would suggest to improve the organization of the interactive features and label the graphs. 
- This is my group
- I think add some instructions would be better. Not just simply show graphs.
- Add an example CSV file
- Instructions?
- The graphs could be labeled better
- Black is a pretty aggressive background, maybe a light color? Then again it does add nice contrast to the color of the map. My main thing would be to add some stat summaries in the comparison? 
- More comprehensive introduction of the app also try to label the graphs
- There should be a guide that explain the colors on the graphs and the types of graphs
label the plots
- the racecar package is not available to everyone
- I don't know if the file we upload should be in a certain formula. But it would be better if the data behind this app update automatically.




## Changes before submitting

- Add a more comprehensive introduction, include screenshots of the app to aid in explaination
- label all of the graphs
- Provide information on color scales
